Today will be mostly lab time. First let's recreate the page below. We'll do it one step at a time starting with the header and footer, then nav, table and then the respnsive columns. Try each section on your own then we will do each section together. There will be time at the end of class to start (and maybe finish) the [Bootstrap homework assignment.] (https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/863546/assignments/2882872)

Code examples can be found at [getbootstrap.com.] (http://getbootstrap.com/)

as time allows keep adding to this project. Try installing components like a slideshow, button groups and a jumbotron or [JavaScript components] (http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) like tabs or tooltips. When your page gets long consider adding [scrollspy] (http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy) to give the feel of a single page app.

Experiment with styling your page using a theme from [bootswatch] (http://bootswatch.com/) or customize your css by hand or with the [Bootstrap Customizer.] (http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) 

As time allows begin your [Bootstrap homework assignment.] (https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/863546/assignments/2882872)
