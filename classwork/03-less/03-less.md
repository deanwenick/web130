More on LESS
======

## First part of class let's review 02-less

The LESS and CSS code is in 02-less
Get the LESS files working so that you get the same results as with the CSS file

## Get in pairs from first day

experiment with the LESS file to help each other figure out what's going on

### We are going to make a navbar with LESS

This will be a pair programming exercise so we can help each other understand what is going on here. Team up in the pairs from the first day. Work on the other person's computer today. Do [this tutorial] (http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/less-css-tutorial-design-slick-menu-nav-bar/) together. Make sure to make frequent git commits. Make a lot of comments in your code. 

_the prefix step in the tutorial will not work. Use [colorzilla] (http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/) to get your gradients, sample code is in the class repository_

After you get this working on one site get it set up on your partner's site as well

Now work on the second person's site and install [font awesome] (http://font-awesome.io). Use the "easy" method under "getting started" where you download and link the file. Put an icon on the left side of your new menu bar

get font awesome working on the other person's site

Last step: install font awesome at the root of your class directory and put the `fa-caret-down` icon next to "classwork" to indicate that that is a dropdown menu.

Very last step: link to 03-less from your class root nav

OK, one more - push everything to github
