css dropdown menus
======

CSS 3 gives us the ability to hide, show and animate elements without the complexity of JavaScript.

We can start by making a sample dropdown menu together in class. 

#### Before we do the exercise, set up your file structure for today and review git
add files and folders, as needed to make this file structure:

```
www
  classwork
    01-css-dropdown
      index.html
      styles.css
  css
    styles.css
  js
    scripts.js
  about.html
  contact.html
  index.html
  README.md
```

you should already have most of that and just need to add the classwork folder and contents. Try to use the command line to do this. You will need some basic commands:


| command  |  meaning |
| --- | --- |
|pwd | present working directory |
| ls | list the files and folders in this directory |
| ls -a | list all files and folders, including hidden files |
| cd | change directory, use ../ to go up a directory |
| mkdir | make a directory (folder) name it inline **mkdir myFolder** |
|  touch | make a file **touch myFile.html** |
| rm | remove (delete) a file |
| rm -r | remove recursively (used for folders) |
| rm -rf | force remove - can be used to remove hidden files like .git |


#### Git commands
git is our version control system. add your new folders to the git tracking, make a commit and push your files to your github account.

The most basic commands we will be using with git will follow this pattern:

1. make changes to code
2. run   `git status` on the command line to verify what has change. If it looks good:
2. add changes to git on command line with `git add .`
3. run `git commit -m "some short message"`
4. run `git push origin master` to send code to github. enter your username and password

If you get this done before the rest of the class move on and learn more about the [command line] (https://github.com/thomaswilburn/itc240-2014/blob/master/assignment-0/command-line.md) here.
Once your code is backed up on the github and you have experience creating a repository you could even delete everything in your box and do this tutorial to [fork a repo] (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
**To erase everything and start again**

1. make sure your git repo is up to date
2. navigate to your workspace folder
3. remove the www folder with `rm -rf www`
4. run `git clone <https://github.com/path/toproject`
