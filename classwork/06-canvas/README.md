### Make a `06-canvas` project folder in your `classwork` directory

This is all you need to get started today:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>HTML Canvas</title>
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
        <script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
</head>
<body>

  <canvas id="drawing" width="300px" height="300px">
    Your browser does not support the canvas element
   </canvas>

</body>
</html>
```
