### Style Guides

consistent formatting of your code is essential to being taken seriously as a web designer and/or developer  
your employer will have specific style guidelines for how you format and comment your code  
this class does not use a specific styleguide, but your code should still look nice  
computers don't care what your code looks like, e.g. minified code is called "uglified"  
Below are some well respected style guides to help you make formatting decisions for your own code
