Resources and tips for finding work
======

Your certificate from Seattle Central will prove that you have a good foundation of skills. The problem is that a lot of people have the same set of skills. Your next task, finding work, can be broken down into two steps:

1. getting yourself in front of people who are hiring
2. making yourself stand out from the crowd

### Staffing Agencies

Agencies can be a good start for new professionals as a way to get your foor foot in the door with a low commitment for both the employer and employee, and offer opportunities to meet people. The agencies want to get you hired so they will give you help with resumes and interview coaching as well. The caveat is that they rely on large numbers of applicants to "send out" to employers so be selective when you sign up with them and make sure you do not get into an "exclusive" relationship with one.
